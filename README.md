Here I have 8 weekly tasks  which I have completed in this order:

1. helloworld.py
2. bank.py
3. accounts.py
4. collatz.py
5. weekday.py
6. squareroot.py
7. es.py
8. plottask.py


-helloworld.py
This program prints out 'Hello World'.

-bank.py
This script prompts the user and reads in two money amounts (in cents) and adds the two amounts.
It prints out the answer in a human readable format with a euro sign and decimal point between 
the euro and cent of the amount.

-accounts.py
This script reads in a 10 character account number and outputs the account number 
with only the last 4 digits showing (and the first 6 digits replaced with Xs).

-collatz.py
This script asks the user to input any positive integer and outputs the successive values 
of the following calculation. At each step calculate the next value by taking the current value and, 
if it is even, divide it by two but if it is odd, multiply it by three and add one.
The program ends if the current value is 1.

-weekday.py
This program outputs whether or not today is a weekday.

-squareroot.py
This program takes a positive floating-point number 
as input and outputs an approximation of its square root.

-es.py
This program reads in a text file and outputs the number of e's it contains.

-plottask.py
This program displays a histogram of a normal distribution of a 1000 values with a mean 
of 5 and standard deviation of 2, and a plot of the function h(x)=x3  in the range [0, 10], 
on the one set of axes.
